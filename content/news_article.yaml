      content: "<p>The winners of Australia&rsquo;s peak international design awards were announced on Friday 8 September at the 2023 Australian Good Design Awards in front of more than 1000 guests from the design and architecture community.</p>\n<p>Voyager received a prestigious Good Design Award Winner Accolade in the Product Design category in recognition for outstanding design and innovation.</p>\n<p>The Good Design Awards Jury commented:&nbsp;&ldquo;The bespoke and holistic design of Voyager shows a clear desire to reinvent the status-quo of the contemporary parking system. We are impressed by the level of vandal-proofing achieved and its focus on easy installation, scalability and customisation. It&rsquo;s evident that customer experience was at the forefront of design.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Good Design Awards are the highest honour for design and innovation in the country and reward diverse projects across 11 Design Disciplines covering more than 35 Categories and Subcategories.&nbsp;Each year, the Awards celebrate the best new products and services on the Australian and international market, excellence in architectural design, engineering, fashion, digital and communication design, and reward new and emerging areas of design including design strategy, social impact design, design research and up-and-coming design talent in the next-gen category.</p>\n<p>The 2023 Good Design Awards attracted high-quality design projects from Australia and around the world. These innovative projects were evaluated by more than 70 Australian and international Jurors, including designers, engineers, architects and thought leaders. More than 900 entries were evaluated according to a strict set of design evaluation criteria which includes&nbsp;Good Design,&nbsp;Design Innovation&nbsp;and&nbsp;Design&nbsp;Impact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To be recognised with an Australian Good Design Award tells the world this project not only represents design excellence, but it also surpasses the criteria for design innovation and design impact. The Good Design Award is an independent endorsement of professional design quality,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Dr. Brandon Gien, CEO of Good Design Australia and Chair of the Australian Good Design Awards.</p>\n<p>The Australian Good Design Awards is the country&rsquo;s oldest and most prestigious international awards for design and innovation with a proud history dating back to 1958. The 2023 Awards celebrated&nbsp;65 Years of Good Design&nbsp;since the founding organisation behind the awards &ndash; the Industrial Design Council of Australia (IDCA) was first established.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is incredible to see how design has changed over the past 65 years. While we celebrate this important milestone for Australian design, we also pay our respect to the oldest living designers on this planet who have been designing and creating for more than 65,000 years. We have such a deeply rich and diverse design culture in Australia to draw and learn from as we shape the next 65 years of design,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Dr. Gien.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://good-design.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Good Design Awards Jury</a>&nbsp;spent two days at the Sydney Opera House discussing and debating which projects should be recognised with the prestigious Good Design Award accolade.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some of the Award-winning projects from this year&rsquo;s Good Design Awards are truly ground-breaking. There are so many inspiring impact-led projects this year that have embraced the power of design as a problem-solving tool &ndash; their design stories deserve to be recognised and celebrated at the highest level. We are proud to continue the legacy of celebrating design, and designers making a positive impact on our world. The Good Design Awards showcase what true design excellence looks like, to inspire others to greatness &ndash; that&rsquo;s exactly what these Awards are about.</p>\n<p>Projects recognised with an Australian Good Design Award demonstrate excellence in professional design and highlight the impact a design-led approach has on business success and social and environmental outcomes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Good Design Awards recognise and celebrate the transformative power of design to find innovative, customer-centric solutions to local and global challenges. My sincere congratulations to all the designers, engineers, architects and innovators recognised in this year&rsquo;s Awards - you deserve to be celebrated at the highest level possible,&rdquo; Dr. Gien concluded.</p>\n<h3>PROJECT DETAILS</h3>\n<p><strong>Project Title: </strong>Voyager</p>\n<p><strong>Designed in: </strong>Australia</p>\n<p><strong>Designed by:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Secure Parking</p>\n<p>4design Pty Ltd</p>\n<p><strong>Commissioned by:</strong></p>\n<p>Park24 Group</p>\n<p>Secure Parking (Australia)</p>\n<p>Peter Anson - CEO</p>\n<p>Rick Chandra - CIO</p>\n<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Secure parking is transforming the global parking industry through the creation of &ldquo;Voyager&rdquo;, an IoT carparking solution designed, developed and manufactured in Australia.

Without a lift at his local station and packed peak-time trains, it's just too difficult to manoeuvre his son and the stroller on and off public transport.</p>\n<p>But after discovering he was paying a small fortune on parking each week, he investigated the online app for the car park nearest his office at Pyrmont.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not very tech-savvy, but it didn't take me long to work out how much I could save by booking my parking space online in advance,\" says Serratore, who works as a valuer. \"I'm always on my phone anyway, so it wasn't too much of a bother to go on to Secure-a-Spot. And I found I was saving so much money &ndash; and time &ndash; by organising it in advance.\"</p>\n<p>A major survey of more than 3000 people living within 40 kilometres of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, conducted by Australia's largest car park operator Secure Parking, found that online bookings generally delivered savings of up to 60 per cent on the standard casual parking fee.</p>\n<p>At Serratore's car park at 320 Harris Street, for instance, the drive-up rate per day is $39, and the online Secure-a-Spot rate is $30. For early bird parking, the saving is even more: the drive-up rate is the same at $39, but the online booking rate is $14 &ndash; meaning a potential saving of $600 over four weeks.</p>\n<p>Secure Parking spokesman Andrew Sapir says car parking is usually a \"grudge purchase\" but it can be a lot more affordable than most people think. \"There is definitely a perception that parking is very expensive but if you plan it ahead, you can get it at a much cheaper rate,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of people still drive into the Sydney CBD, drive round and round, then go into the first car park they see as they're running late. But there are now a lot of options out there and if they think ahead, and book online, it can be much cheaper than they imagined. I would be confident enough to say that off-peak parking through Secure-a-Spot is cheaper than parking has been for 15-20 years.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The survey also found that 47 per cent of drivers always, or regularly, drive around to find an on-street parking spot &ndash; something that Lorraine Duffy, CEO of the industry peak body Parking Australia, says accounts for 30 per cent of traffic congestion in Sydney.</p>\n<p>\"You wouldn't go away and then just turn up at a hotel and ask for a room,\" she says. \"You'd book that in advance, so you don't have to pay the rack rate.</p>\n<p>\"Well, we have to start thinking about parking in the same way. If you plan your trip before you leave, and then book a car space online, then you'll know where you're going and get the best bang for your buck at the same time.
