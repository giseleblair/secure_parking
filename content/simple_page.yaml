These are your legal rights and obligations, so please do read everything. By accessing and using the App, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you can&rsquo;t agree to our terms, then you can&rsquo;t use the App. If you still have questions or comments after you&rsquo;ve read these terms, please <a href=\"/contact-us\">get in touch with us via our website</a>. We&rsquo;d love to help.</p>\n<p>The App is made available to you to facilitate your use of Secure Parking services.</p>\n<h3>Joining and using our App</h3>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>You and Secure Parking</strong>:&nbsp;When we say&nbsp;<strong>you&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>, we mean both you and any entity or firm you&rsquo;re authorised to represent. When we say&nbsp;<strong>Secure Parking</strong>, <strong>we</strong>, <strong>our&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>us</strong>, we&rsquo;re talking about the Secure Parking entity you contract with and pay fees to based on the Secure Parking products and services you are using, including the edition of the App you&rsquo;re using. Refer to the table at the end of these terms of use to determine which Secure Parking entity you contract with.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>App</strong>:&nbsp;When we refer to the App we mean the Secure Parking mobile application (including any updates, enhancements, modifications or variations) we make available on third party application stores for you to download onto your mobile device.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Our services</strong>:&nbsp;Our&nbsp;<strong>services&nbsp;</strong>consist of all the products and services we provide now or in the future, including the provision of the App to facilitate your use of our all casual or permanent/monthly parking services.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Creating a profile</strong>:&nbsp;When you create a&nbsp;<strong>user profile</strong>&nbsp;to use the App and accept these terms, you become a user. If you&rsquo;re the user, you&rsquo;re the one responsible for paying for the service(s) you are using.</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>The right to use the App</strong>:&nbsp;We grant you the right to use the App until your user profile is terminated or until your access is revoked.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Rules</strong>:&nbsp;When you use the App you agree to follow these terms. Please read them and make sure you understand what you should and shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Your responsibilities</strong>:&nbsp;You promise that you&rsquo;ll keep your information (including a current email address) up to date. You&rsquo;re responsible for providing true, accurate and complete information and for verifying the accuracy of any information that you use from the App or any of our services for your legal, tax and compliance obligations. You&rsquo;re also responsible for protecting your username and password from getting stolen or misused. The App has minimum password standards but you are responsible for ensuring that your password is very strong and cannot be easily guessed. The stronger the password the better!</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp;<strong>When we introduce new or revised features</strong>:&nbsp;We will keep thinking about how to improve the App. If we introduce new or updated features, there might be additional terms. We&rsquo;ll let you know what those terms are before you start using those new or updated features. If you continue to use the App after they become available, you will be considered to have accepted the amended Secure Parking App terms of use.</p>\n<p>9.&nbsp;<strong>What we own</strong>:&nbsp;We or our licensors own, or have a licence to use, everything put into the App unless otherwise stated and excluding content owned by others. This includes (but is not limited to) rights in the design, compilation, and look and feel of our services. It also includes rights in all copyright works, trade marks, designs, inventions, and other intellectual property in, and in connection with the App. Other than as specified in clause 5 above, you do not acquire any rights to our intellectual property by using the App or our services. You agree not to copy, distribute, modify or make derivative works of the App or its content, or anything provided to you in connection with the App or our services, or use any of our intellectual property rights in any way not expressly permitted by us.</p>\n<h3>Services</h3>\n<p>10.&nbsp;<strong>Use of our services</strong>:&nbsp;You may use the App to access and use the Secure Parking services we may offer from time to time. Your use of such Secure Parking services will also be subject to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<a href=\"/about/stuff-to-know/car-park-terms-of-entry\">Secure Parking Terms of Entry</a>;</li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<a href=\"/about/stuff-to-know/privacy-policy\">Secure Parking Privacy Policy</a>; and</li>\n<li>the particular terms of service that apply specifically to particular Secure Parking services. Each Secure Parking service&rsquo;s corresponding terms and conditions are as follows:&nbsp;\n<ul>\n<li>Online Booking&nbsp;Services -&nbsp;<a href=\"/about/stuff-to-know/booking-terms\">Online Booking&nbsp;Terms and Conditions</a></li>\n<li>Secure Parking Permanent Parking Services -&nbsp;<a href=\"/about/stuff-to-know/permanent-parking-agreement\">Secure Parking Permanent Parking Agreement</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>11. In the event that there is any inconsistency between these terms, and the applicable service&rsquo;s terms and conditions, the applicable service&rsquo;s terms and conditions will take precedence.</p>\n<h3>Payment for Services</h3>\n<p>12.&nbsp;<strong>Invoices &amp; Payment</strong>:&nbsp;An invoice is automatically generated whenever you incur a billable service through the App. Payment of invoices are processed by Windcave, a third party PCI DSS compliant payment processor. No credit card details are stored within the App.</p>\n<p>13.&nbsp;<strong>Taxes</strong>:&nbsp;Depending on your region, fees for the applicable paid service may be inclusive or exclusive of transactional taxes where relevant (like Value Added Tax and Goods and Services Tax), as reflected in pricing for the applicable service.</p>\n<p>14.&nbsp;<strong>Importance of timely payments</strong>:&nbsp;To avoid delayed or missed payments, please make sure we have accurate payment information. If we don&rsquo;t receive timely payments, we may suspend access to your user profile until the payment is made.</p>\n<h3>Data use and privacy</h3>\n<p>15.&nbsp;<strong>Collection and Use of data</strong>:&nbsp;When you enter or upload your data into our services, we don&rsquo;t own that data but you grant us a licence to use, copy, transmit, store, analyse, and back up all data you submit to us through our services, including personal data of yourself and others, to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>enable you to use our services;</li>\n<li>allow us to improve, develop and protect our services;</li>\n<li>create new services;</li>\n<li>communicate with you about your user profile;</li>\n<li>carry out our billing/administration purposes; and</li>\n<li>send you offers, benefits and information about our goods and services, and those of our related entities and third parties that we think may be of interest to you based on your marketing preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>16.&nbsp;<strong>Use of personal data</strong>:&nbsp;We respect your privacy and take data protection seriously. In addition to these terms,&nbsp;<a href=\"/about/stuff-to-know/privacy-policy\">our privacy policy</a>&nbsp;sets out in detail the personal data we collect, the purposes for which it may be used, who it may be shared with, and your rights to access and correct that information.</p>\n<p>17.&nbsp;Personal data of other individuals:&nbsp;If you are providing to Secure Parking any personal data (such as name and contact details) about another individual, you confirm that you are authorised by that individual to provide that information to us so that we are able to use that information for the purposes outlined above.</p>\n<p>18.&nbsp;Anonymised statistical data:&nbsp;When you use our services, we may create anonymised statistical data from your data and usage of our services, including through aggregation. Once anonymised, we may use it for our own purposes, such as to provide and improve our services, to develop new services or product offerings, to identify business trends, and for other uses we communicate to you.</p>\n<p>19.&nbsp;Data breach notifications:&nbsp;Where we think there has been unauthorised or accidental access to, or disclosure, alteration, loss or destruction of the personal data inside your user profile (Security Incident), we will handle the Security Incident in accordance with relevant privacy laws. This may require us to notify the relevant privacy regulators and/or you about what has happened.</p>\n<h3>Confidential information</h3>\n<p>20.&nbsp;<strong>Keeping it confidential</strong>:&nbsp;While using our services, you may share confidential information with us, and you may become aware of confidential information about us. You and we both agree to take reasonable steps to protect each other&rsquo;s confidential information from being accessed by unauthorised persons. You or we may share each other&rsquo;s confidential information with legal or regulatory authorities if required to do so.</p>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>21.<strong>&nbsp;Security safeguards</strong>:&nbsp;While we, our licensors and our service providers may have taken steps to help protect your data, no method of electronic storage or transmission of data over the Internet is always completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security. While we do what we can to protect your information, we don&rsquo;t warrant and can&rsquo;t ensure the security of any information you transmit to us. We will notify you if there appears to be unauthorised access to your account and we may also restrict access to certain parts of our services until you verify that access was by an authorised user.</p>\n<p>22.&nbsp;<strong>Account security features:</strong>&nbsp;We, or our licensors of the App, may introduce security features to make your account more secure. You may be required to adopt some of these features. Where the use of security features is optional, you&rsquo;re responsible (meaning we&rsquo;re not liable) for any consequences of not using those features. We strongly encourage you to use all optional security features.</p>\n<p>23.&nbsp;<strong>Playing your part to secure your data</strong>:&nbsp;You have an important part to play by keeping your login details secure, not letting any other person use them, and by making sure you have strong security on your own systems/device(s). If you realise there&rsquo;s been any unauthorised use of your password or any breach of security to your account or email address linked to your account, you need to let us know immediately.</p>\n<h3>App store terms</h3>\n<p>24.&nbsp;<strong>Other services</strong>:&nbsp;Some of our services are available through other companies&rsquo; services, such as The Apple App Store. These companies may have additional terms that apply to you.</p>\n<p>25.&nbsp;<strong>Third-party products and services</strong>:&nbsp;From time to time, we may make third party products and services available on, or through, our App, or you may use third party products and services in conjunction with our App. You acknowledge and agree that if you do so, such third-party products and services are&nbsp; &nbsp;independent of us and we have not prepared, nor do we manage, any such third party products/services. We may allow access to, or use of, such third party products and services through or in conjunction with our App to potentially facilitate and enhance your user experience only. We do not represent, endorse or warrant that the third party products or services will operate in the manner represented by the relevant third party provider or that they will be suitable for your use, be error-free or continue to be available to you. Please be aware that your use of a third party product/service through our App may incur fees with the third party provider and you may be subject to additional terms.</p>\n<h3>Maintenance, downtime and data loss</h3>\n<p>26.&nbsp;<strong>Availability</strong>:&nbsp;We strive to maintain the availability of our services, and provide online support, 24 hours a day. On occasion, we need to perform maintenance on our services, and this may require a period of downtime. We try to minimise any such downtime. Where planned maintenance is being undertaken, we&rsquo;ll attempt to notify you in advance but can&rsquo;t guarantee it.</p>\n<p>27.&nbsp;<strong>Access issues:</strong>&nbsp;You know how the Internet works &ndash; occasionally you might not be able to access our services and your data. This might happen for any number of reasons, at any time.</p>\n<p>28.&nbsp;<strong>Data loss</strong>:&nbsp;Data loss is an unavoidable risk when using any technology. Any information you transmit to us is at your own risk and you&rsquo;re responsible for maintaining copies of your data entered into our services.</p>\n<p>29.&nbsp;<strong>No compensation</strong>:&nbsp;Whatever the cause of any downtime, access issues or data loss, your only recourse is to discontinue using our services.</p>\n<p>30.&nbsp;<strong>Problems and support</strong>:&nbsp;If you have a problem with our services, you can contact our support team by emailing&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:help@secureparking.com.au?subject=App%20Services%20Feedback\">help@secureparking.com.au</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>31.&nbsp;<strong>Modifications</strong>:&nbsp;We frequently release new updates, modifications and enhancements to our services, and in some cases discontinue features.

You agree to use our services only for lawful business purposes and in line with the instructions and guidance we provide.</p>\n<p>34.&nbsp;<strong>While we can&rsquo;t cover everything here, we do want to highlight a few more examples of things you mustn&rsquo;t ever do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undermine the security or integrity of our computing systems or networks;</li>\n<li>Use our services in any way that might impair functionality or interfere with other people&rsquo;s use;</li>\n<li>Access any system without permission;</li>\n<li>Introduce or upload anything to our services that includes viruses or other malicious code;</li>\n<li>Share anything that may be offensive, violates any law, or infringes on the rights of others;</li>\n<li>Modify, copy, adapt, reproduce, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or extract the source code of any part of our services;</li>\n<li>Resell, lease or provide our services in any way not expressly permitted through our services;</li>\n<li>Repackage, resell, or sublicense any leads or data accessed through our services;</li>\n<li>Commit fraud or other illegal acts through our services; and</li>\n<li>Act in a manner that is abusive or disrespectful to a Secure Parking employee, partner, or other Secure Parking customer.

If you violate these terms, we may terminate your user profile immediately.</p>\n<p>36.&nbsp;<strong>Termination by Secure Parking</strong>:&nbsp;Secure Parking may terminate or suspend your user profile or access to all or any data immediately if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you breach any of these terms and do not remedy the breach within 14 days after receiving notice of the breach;</li>\n<li>you breach any of these terms and the breach cannot be remedied; and/or</li>\n<li>you fail to pay the fees for any of our services; and/or</li>\n<li>you become insolvent or make any arrangement with your creditors, or become subject to any similar insolvency event in any jurisdiction, or your business becomes insolvent, or goes into liquidation or has a receiver or manager appointed over any of its assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>37.&nbsp;<strong>Retention of your data</strong>:&nbsp;Once your user profile is terminated by you or us, it is archived and the data submitted or created by you is no longer available to you. We retain it for a period of time consistent with our data retention policy, during which, as a user, you can reactivate your user profile and once again access your data. We may also retain data in case you need it as part of our record retention obligations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Liability and indemnity</h3>\n<p>38.&nbsp;<strong>You indemnify us</strong>:&nbsp;You indemnify, hold harmless and defend us and our affiliates, officers and employees from all losses, costs (including legal costs), expenses, demands or liability that we incur arising out of, or in connection with, a third-party claim against us relating to your use of our services or any third-party product (except as far as we&rsquo;re at fault).</p>\n<p>39.&nbsp;<strong>Disclaimer of warranties</strong>:&nbsp;Our services and all third-party products are made available to you on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis. Subject to the consumer law terms in section 45, we disclaim all warranties, guarantees and representations (whether express, implied or statutory) including without limit warranties of non-infringement, suitability, accuracy merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and completeness of the services.</p>\n<p>40.&nbsp;<strong>Limitation of liability</strong>: Other than liability that we can&rsquo;t exclude or limit by law, and subject to the consumer law terms in section 46, our liability to you in connection with the App or these terms, in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, is limited as follows:</p>\n<p>We have no liability arising from your use of our services for any loss of revenue or profit, loss of goodwill, loss of customers, loss of capital, loss of anticipated savings, legal, tax or accounting compliance issues, damage to reputation, loss in connection with any other contract, indirect losses, or any consequential damages of any kind, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special loss, damage or expense.</p>\n<p>For loss or corruption of your data, our liability will be limited to taking reasonable steps to try and recover that data from our available backups.</p>\n<p>Our total aggregate liability to you in any circumstances is limited to any fees payable by you for use of the App.</p>\n<h3>Disputes</h3>\n<p>41.&nbsp;<strong>Dispute resolution</strong>:&nbsp;Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction by contacting our support team by emailing help@secureparking.com.au. If we&rsquo;re unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if we haven&rsquo;t been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally), you and we agree to first attempt to resolve those disputes through mediation, with location and procedure of any such mediation to be agreed between the parties.</p>\n<h3>Important housekeeping</h3>\n<p>42.&nbsp;<strong>Events outside our control</strong>:&nbsp;We do our best to control the controllables. We aren&rsquo;t liable to you for any failure or delay in performance of any of our obligations under these terms arising out of any event or circumstance beyond our reasonable control.</p>\n<p>43.&nbsp;<strong>Notices</strong>:&nbsp;Any notice you send to Secure Parking must be sent to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:help@secureparking.com.au?subject=Secure%20Parking%20App%20\">help@secureparking.com.au</a>. Any notices we send to you will be sent to the email address you&rsquo;ve provided us through your user profile.</p>\n<p>44.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>:&nbsp;These terms constitutes the entire agreement, understanding and arrangement (express and implied) between you and Secure Parking in relation to the App and supersedes and cancels any previous terms or agreement, understanding and arrangement relating thereto, whether written or oral.</p>\n<p>45.&nbsp;<strong>Consumer laws</strong>:&nbsp;There may be non-excludable warranties, guarantees or other rights provided by law (non-excludable consumer guarantees). To the extent that you are considered a consumer under the applicable consumer legislation of your jurisdiction, the warranties, guarantees or other rights provided by law may still apply. Nothing in these terms will exclude, restrict or modify the rights and remedies available to you at law. Except for non-excludable consumer guarantees and other rights you have that we cannot exclude, we&rsquo;re bound only by the provisions set out in these terms. To the extent permitted by law, our liability for breach of a non-excludable consumer guarantee is limited, at our option, to either replacing or paying the cost of replacing the relevant service.</p>\n<p>46.&nbsp;<strong>Blocking your access, disabling your user profile, or refusing to process a payment</strong>:&nbsp;We may block your access, terminate your user profile, or refuse to process a payment if we reasonably believe there&rsquo;s a risk associated with you, your company, your user profile or a payment. For example, a risk of a law or regulation potentially being breached or risk of loss being suffered by us, our partners or our customers. You warrant that you&rsquo;re not on a sanctioned persons list. We may take any of the above actions without notice to you.</p>\n<p>47.&nbsp;<strong>Relationship between the parties; assignment</strong>:&nbsp;Nothing in these terms is to be construed as constituting a partnership, joint venture, employment or agency relationship between you and us. Secure Parking may assign these terms - or any of our rights or obligations in these terms - to another Secure Parking entity as it deems appropriate.

      content: "<h4>A finance system update...</h4>\n<p>Over the past year Secure Parking has invested in our corporate and finance systems to improve the way we operate and to make it easier for our customers, business partners and employees to do business with us.</p>\n<p>In mid-2022, we will introduce a new purchasing requisition system (P2P), which merges purchasing to payment and standardises the way we order and pay for goods and services across Australia. Here is a snapshot of the changes ahead and some tips on how to prepare.</p>\n<h3>Quotations</h3>\n<p>When P2P is introduced, quotations will be required for us to raise a purchase requisition (unless you are a supplier with agreed contracted rates). Please provide a written quote every time we initiate a new purchase.</p>\n<h3>Purchase Orders</h3>\n<p>Upon approval, we will issue your business with an electronic purchase order. Please use our PO number on all correspondence relating to our order as soon as you receive it.</p>\n<h3>Invoicing</h3>\n<p>Once P2P is launched it will become a requirement to include our purchase order number or in the case of contractual agreements, our contract number on any invoice you send us. Invoices that are successfully matched with a PO/contract number will be validated and made ready for payment. Please&nbsp;ensure you are paid on time by adjusting your invoices to include our PO/Contract number.</p>\n<p>Our new P2P system will make doing business with us easier and will help foster stronger relationships and faster payments. For more information about Procure to Pay, please speak to your usual Secure Parking business contact.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support as we transition to this new system.</p>\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<p><strong>What is P2P?</strong></p>\n<p>P2P stands for Procure to Pay - a purchasing and contract management system we are introducing at Secure Parking.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do I need to provide quotations for goods or services?</strong></p>\n<p>When we raise a purchase requisition in P2P, it must include the price for the order. Quotations help us fill out the details for the requisition correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>How will purchase orders be sent to me?</strong></p>\n<p>Purchase orders will be sent to you from our P2P system using the email address you&rsquo;ve previously provided to our Accounts Payable team. If you want POs sent to a different email address, please advise us now at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:payables@secureparking.com.au?subject=Change%20of%20email%20address\" title=\"Contact us\">payables@secureparking.com.au</a></p>\n<p><strong>I provide services &ndash; can your system support progress claims?</strong></p>\n<p>Progress claims are easily processed in our P2P system.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any changes I need to make to my invoice?</strong></p>\n<p>Please ensure you include our purchase order or contract number on all your invoices to Secure Parking in P2P from mid-2022. If your invoicing system isn&rsquo;t set up for this, please make the necessary adjustments. We will contact you with a specific timeframe, closer to the implementation date.</p>\n<p><strong>My company has a contract with Secure Parking. When will you give me the contract number?</strong></p>\n<p>When the system is live we will send you your contract number via email.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure just ordered something from my company which will be invoiced soon. Can I still bill you without a PO number?</strong></p>\n<p>Items under order prior to P2P&rsquo;s go live in mid-22 will still be processed and paid while we complete migration to our new process. Contract numbers will be issued following go live and any subsequent new orders will require a purchase order number before they can be accepted for payment.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there any change to the email address I send invoices to?</strong></p>\n<p>Our Accounts Payable email address remains unchanged for Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Will there be any disruption to invoice payment?</strong></p>\n<p>Our Finance system will be offline for a short period in the week before P2P launches. A catch up pay-cycle will be run once we are migrated to P2P.</p>\n<p><strong>Who can I speak to if I have questions?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have questions about our new P2P system, please contact our Accounts Payable team by emailing&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:payables@secureparking.com.au?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20know%20more%20about%20P2P\" title=\"Learn more\">payables@secureparking.com.au</a></p>"

The access PIN or QR code you get when you book will allow you to enter and exit any time within the specified entry and exit conditions only. If you enter or exit outside of these conditions, you will be charged the hourly parking rate instead of the Early Bird Parking rate. The only exception to this is if you make your Early Bird booking 15 minutes prior to the end of the Early Bird Parking entry condition, as all online bookings have a 15-minute grace period. Please be aware there is no grace period for exiting. For more information <a href=\"/en-au/parking-solutions/early-bird-parking/\">click here</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item has-children\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item-title\">Night and Weekend Parking - why is the time I entered different to the time on my booking?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-subitem\">\n<div class=\"desc\">Night and Weekend Parking are generally (there are exceptions) flat rate evening and all day weekend parking. When you book the time selected is a general guide to when you expect to park but the times displayed on the booking confirmation is the full time you can be in the car park before any overstay charges apply.

They have access to the Booking System and can verify the details of your booking to help you enter or exit. Please note that your PIN or QR code is only valid for the booking time and date that you have selected. If you arrive at the car park outside of your booking entry time, you will be required to pay for the time you have spent in the car park, starting from your booking entry time.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item has-children\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item-title\">The car park I've entered is full, what can I do?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-subitem\">\n<div class=\"desc\">We do our best to manage occupancy in the car park to accommodate our Online Booking customers. There are times when drive up demand in the car park increases significantly and fast. If the car park becomes full, please press the intercom button at the entry, exit or automatic pay station and our friendly Customer Support team will direct you to the most convenient parking nearby.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item has-children\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item-title\">I've lost my ticket, what can I do?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-subitem\">\n<div class=\"desc\">If your car park provides tickets and you have lost your ticket, we cannot determine the length of time that you have spent in the car park so a lost ticket fee will be charged. You can pay the lost ticket fee by selecting \"Lost Ticket&rdquo;, on the car park equipment or alternatively you can pay through the intercom by contacting a member of our friendly Customer Service team, or calling us on 02 8000 8790 (AUS) and 09 200 2400 (NZ) The lost ticket fee amount can be found on the rate board at the pay station, or at the entry and exit of the car park. You can also visit the car park page on our website. Simply, click the button \"Find a Car Park, located at the top of the page on our website and follow the prompts to search. Once you're on your desired car park page, scroll to the right hand-side till you see \"Special Conditions - Things You Need to Know\". We strongly recommend keeping your ticket in a safe place to ensure you pay the appropriate rate for the time you have spent in the car park. We also recommend keeping your ticket away from your mobile phone, as this may damage the magnetic strip.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item has-children\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item-title\">The boomgate was up when I was entering/exiting the car park.

If you do not use your PIN number or QR Code upon entry, it will not allow you to exit the car park. When you do not use your PIN number or QR Code upon exit, you may be charged an additional cost as our Online Booking system may still register you as being inside the car park, even if you have left.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item has-children\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-item-title\">How do I know if my preferred car park is open or suitable for my car?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"car-park-detail__accordion-subitem\">\n<div class=\"desc\">We've included information about operating hours, parking types/solutions, payment options and height restrictions on our website for each car park.

If you breach any term of this Agreement, and fail to remedy such a breach within two days of receiving notice from Secure to do so, Secure may, without prejudice to its other rights hereunder, terminate this Agreement with immediate effect.</p>\n<p>5.5 You may request an increase in your Nominated Days at any time by notice to Secure. You may also request a decrease in your Nominated Days at time after the Minimum Term by providing not less than one month&rsquo;s written notice to Secure.</p>\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;Variation of the Agreed Number</strong></p>\n<p>6.1 Should you require additional Permanent Parking Spaces from time to time then, subject to availability, Secure may agree to vary the Agreed Number and recalculate the Permanent Space Fee for that number of Agreed Spaces. Such additional Permanent Parking Space(s) are made available on the terms and conditions in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>6.2 Should you wish to reduce the Agreed Number you may do so by terminating the Permanent Parker Licence for Permanent Parking Spaces subject to notice and payment as provided for in clauses 5.2 and 5.3.</p>\n<p>6.3 You acknowledge that the Permanent Space Fee is calculated at the Market Rate for the Agreed Number and may include a volume discount. If you change the Agreed Number, Secure reserves the right to charge you the Market Rate for the new Agreed Number. This is in addition to any other rights of variation Secure has under this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;Bay and Secure Car Park allocation</strong></p>\n<p>7.1 You only have the exclusive right to use a Permanent Parking Space if you have elected, and Secure has approved, a reserved space as set out in your Application, otherwise you have no exclusive right to use a Permanent Parking Space.</p>\n<p>7.2 Secure may, from time to time:</p>\n<p>(a) if it considers it reasonably necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the relevant Secure Car Park, on notice allocate you an alternative Permanent Parking Space.</p>\n<p>(b) amend your Permanent Parking Space from a reserved space to an unreserved space (Space Change) and recalculate the Permanent Space Fees as required to reflect the Space Change. Notice of the Space Change and the Permanent Space Fees will be provided to you by Secure in accordance with clause 12.1.</p>\n<p>7.3 Without limiting Secure&rsquo;s rights under clause 7.2, Secure may also at its discretion provide a Permanent Parking Space on the terms of this Agreement at a reasonably nearby car park instead of the Secure Car Park specified in your Application. Reallocation to a nearby car park is at Secure&rsquo;s sole discretion and may be made for operational reasons, including but not limited to, damage to or closure of any Secure Car Park, road closures or other operational reasons affecting Secure, including if a Secure Car Park becomes unavailable to Secure. Upon reallocation by Secure, any necessary changes shall be deemed made to your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, your use of a Permanent Parking Space to which you have been allocated in another car park is still subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;Vehicle access</strong></p>\n<p>8.1 Before parking a Vehicle you must validate your Access Device. To validate your Access Device you must notify Secure of the Vehicle to which the Access Device corresponds, the Vehicle owner&rsquo;s name and the Vehicle&rsquo;s registration number (and any other details Secure requests) and Secure must confirm access to the Secure Car Park for that Vehicle.</p>\n<p>8.2 If you use an Access Device, or permit it to be used, so as to park more than the Agreed Number of Vehicles in a Secure Car Park at any one time, you agree to pay for parking the excess vehicles at the daily tariff rates for casual parking at the relevant Secure Car Park at the time those vehicles were parked in the Secure Car Park. Secure may require you to pay this amount at any time.</p>\n<p>8.3 As a condition of granting such additional access to the Secure Car Park, Secure may charge you its then current fee for issue or alteration of additional Access Devices. Where access arrangements are varied as to the Vehicle or otherwise, you must also pay Secure&rsquo;s then current charges for relevant system changes (including but not limited to licence plate recognition) or if no fee is then current, a fee Secure determines in its discretion acting reasonably.</p>\n<p>8.4 If you are not in possession of your validated Access Device, or your Access Device is deactivated for any reason, then when entering or leaving a Secure Car Park you must pay the daily parking tariff for casual parking at the Secure Car Park at that time. All physical Access Devices remain the property of Secure and must be returned when this Agreement terminates, or earlier if Secure requests. Should any Access Device not be returned for any reason, or be damaged, you must pay Secure&rsquo;s then current Access Device replacement fee.</p>\n<p><strong>9.&nbsp;Payment</strong></p>\n<p>9.1 You must pay Secure the Permanent Space Fees without any deduction monthly in advance. Permanent Space Fees are due and payable before the first day of every calendar month, with the first pro rata payment due on the date of this Agreement. Secure may charge a reasonable fee for processing payments made by credit card.</p>\n<p>9.2 Any other purchase, receipt, consumption, value added tax, sales tax, levy, or any other duty tax or other impost that may be imposed in respect of any Permanent Parking Space or upon car parking or upon using the Secure Car Park (Parking Impost), or upon this Agreement or anything supplied under this Agreement, is not included in the Permanent Space Fees or other fees that may be charged to you from time to time. You must pay to Secure any Parking Impost charged to, or payable by, Secure by law or otherwise to the extent which Secure considers the Parking Impost directly or indirectly attributable or apportionable to any Permanent Parking Space or any supply to you and that amount shall be recoverable by Secure on demand.</p>\n<p><strong>10.&nbsp;Parking and related obligations</strong></p>\n<p>10.1 You agree with Secure:</p>\n<p>(a) that your obligation to pay any amount, fee or charge set out in this Agreement arises at the time specified for payment of that amount, fee or charge or, if no time is specified, on the completion of the services to which that amount, fee or charge relates.</p>\n<p>(b) to pay Secure&rsquo;s reasonable charges for any additional service (such as battery charging, call-out or after-hours exit) Secure may provide to you from time to time.</p>\n<p>(c) to pay interest on demand to Secure in respect of any amounts, fee or charge not paid when due under this Agreement. Interest is to be calculated daily at the cash target rate published by the Reserve Bank of Australia from time to time plus a margin of 3% per annum. If that rate is unavailable Secure may choose a reasonably equivalent rate.</p>\n<p>(d) to comply with all the rules and regulations relating to the management and use of each Secure Car Park as may be made from time to time by Secure, and to obey all lawful directions given by Secure and in particular, those applicable to the display or use of the Access Device, speed restrictions, traffic flow directions and areas designated as being either \"no parking\" or \"reserved parking\". The conditions of parking displayed at the entrance or within a Secure Car Park from time to time shall be deemed to be incorporated in this Agreement so far as they are not varied by or inconsistent with the express terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(e) to use the Secure Car Park only during the Authorised Access Hours.</p>\n<p>(f) (if applicable) to allow Secure to access for any lawful purpose (including but not limited to carrying out repairs in a Secure Car Park) any part of a Secure Car Park which you may be entitled to access but Secure would not for any reason be entitled to access but for this clause.</p>\n<p>(g) to ensure that any Authorised Parker complies with all obligations of this Agreement in respect of parking, access and conduct, as if they were you.</p>\n<p>(h) that Secure may act on and you will be bound by any person appearing or purporting to act on your behalf in respect of all matters to do with this Agreement including its variation and termination.</p>\n<p>(i) to comply with Secure&rsquo;s requirements from time to time about the manner of payment of payment amounts under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(j) to take all reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorised use of any Access Device.</p>\n<p>(k) that Secure may request your (or your Authorised Parker&rsquo;s) proof of identity or signature at points of exits of Secure car parks.</p>\n<p>(l) to pay Secure for any damage caused by you, your Authorised Parker, or your Vehicle to the relevant Secure Car Park including, but not limited to, any damage caused by oil or other substances which leak from your vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong>11.&nbsp;Security Deposit</strong></p>\n<p>11.1 On signing this Agreement, you must pay the security deposit and account establishment fees recorded in your Application. The security deposit may be held by Secure and applied and set-off by Secure toward any costs incurred by Secure if you breach this Agreement or toward any amount unpaid by you.</p>\n<p><strong>12.&nbsp;Variation of Fees and Space Change</strong></p>\n<p>12.1 Unless otherwise agreed by Secure, Secure may from time to time, give you not less than one month's prior written notice at any time of a variation of the Permanent Space Fee or any other fee specified in your Application, and/or Space Change (Variation). Notice of the Variation will be provided to you by Secure through one or more of the methods of notification prescribed in clause 3 of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the Variation, you have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to Secure within 1 month of receiving notice of the Variation from Secure. You will be deemed to have accepted the Variation if you continue to use your Permanent Parking Space or the Permanent Parking App after expiry of the 1 month notice period.</p>\n<p><strong>13.&nbsp;Risk, liability and Consumer Law</strong></p>\n<p>13.1 The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) provides consumers with guarantees that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. This Agreement does not affect any rights you have under the ACL or any other legal rights which cannot be excluded or modified.</p>\n<p>13.2 For services that are not services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, and/or where you are in trade, you agree that Secure limits its liability, at its option, to the re-supply of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again. To the extent permitted by the ACL and subject to any other legal restriction, Secure excludes:</p>\n<p>(a) all terms, conditions, warranties, guarantees (either express or implied) and any other liability that might apply to Secure in respect of this Agreement or anything done under them; and</p>\n<p>(b) any liability for any indirect, special, consequential or economic loss or damage whether or not arising from default or negligence by Secure or its employees or agents, including loss or damage to your Vehicle.</p>\n<p>13.3 You must indemnify Secure in respect of all losses, costs or expenses which Secure suffers or incurs in respect of: (a) a breach of this Agreement by you or your Authorised Parker, including enforcing them; (b) the Vehicle; or (c) your use, or your Authorised Parker&rsquo;s use, of a Secure Car Park. In the case of paragraphs (b) and (c) your liability to indemnify Secure is reduced to the extent that any relevant expense is caused by Secure&rsquo;s negligence or default.</p>\n<p><strong>14.&nbsp;General</strong></p>\n<p>14.1 Secure and its contractors, employees or agents may move any Vehicle parked in a Secure Car Park (including by entering and driving it, lifting it, sliding it or towing it) if Secure reasonably considers:</p>\n<p>(a) it necessary in an emergency;</p>\n<p>(b) that the Vehicle has been abandoned; and/or</p>\n<p>(c) it necessary for the safe or efficient operation of a Secure Car Park. Secure may charge you a reasonable amount for moving the Vehicle if the need to move it arises because you or your Authorised Parker has breached this Agreement, appear to abandon the Vehicle, or have caused obstruction or during the period of retention or sale for non-payment. Secure may deny a Vehicle access to or departure from a Secure Car Park if any amount you owe Secure has not been received by Secure by the time it is due.</p>\n<p>14.2 Unless the contrary is clear, fees or charges payable under this Agreement are calculated exclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Secure may add GST to any such amount and the GST shall be payable at the same time as fee, charge or other amount is payable. If the fee, charge or other amount is inclusive of GST but the rate of GST varies from that previously applicable, Secure may vary it accordingly.</p>\n<p>14.3 You grant Secure a &lsquo;security interest&rsquo; as defined in the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (<strong>PPSA</strong>) in the Vehicle to secure everything you owe Secure in respect of this Agreement. Secure may retain possession of the vehicle until everything you owe Secure in respect of this Agreement has been paid. Amounts Secure claims will continue to accrue during the period that Secure retains the Vehicle until Secure recovers all amounts from you. If amounts due to Secure in respect of this Agreement remain unpaid after 30 days, you agree that Secure can sell the Vehicle and use the proceeds to pay the amounts you owe Secure and you agree to take all steps required by Secure to enable Secure to do so. Our rights and powers in relation to the security interest described in this clause do not limit our rights and powers under the PPSA. Nothing in this contract limits or excludes any common law or statutory lien or other rights we have over the Vehicle.</p>\n<p>14.4 You agree and accept that Secure does not accept, nor does it have authority to accept, any vehicle or any other goods or chattels for secure or safe parking or custody.</p>\n<p>14.5 The use of the word &lsquo;Secure&rsquo; in the name &lsquo;Secure Parking&rsquo; does not imply anything to the contrary.</p>\n<p>14.6 To the extent permitted by the ACL and subject to any other legal restriction, Secure will not be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever to any such vehicle goods or chattels alleged to have been left with Secure for safe custody howsoever such loss or damage may be caused, whether by the negligence or otherwise of Secure or by the negligence or otherwise of any person acting with or without the authority of Secure.</p>\n<p>14.7 Secure may give you notice under this Agreement by sending a notice to you at the address you give in your Application or any other address you notify to Secure or at any other address where Secure reasonably believes you to work, stay or reside. If you give Secure an email address, Secure may also give you notices by email to that address. Secure may also give you a notice by leaving it on or in your Vehicle inside or outside a Secure Car Park. Each of these methods of notice may also be used to give you notice for the purposes of any legal proceedings. You should notify Secure if your contact details change.</p>\n<p>14.8 You must pay Secure its full costs of any action to recover amounts you owe including Secure&rsquo;s legal and mercantile agents&rsquo; fees on a full indemnity basis.</p>\n<p>14.9 Secure is committed to your privacy and handles all personal information in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We have a privacy policy which records how: (a) Secure collects, stores, uses and discloses your personal information; (b) you may request access to, and correction of, the personal information about you that Secure holds; (c) you may complain about a potential breach by Secure of the applicable privacy laws, and how Secure will deal with such a complaint. A copy of&nbsp;<a href=\"/about/stuff-to-know/privacy-policy\">Secure&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>&nbsp;is available.</p>\n<p>14.10 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any bailment or tenancy or conferring any interest upon you by way of lease or otherwise in a Secure Car Park or Permanent Parking Space. This Agreement is personal to you and you may not transfer any of your rights or obligations in respect of it. Secure may transfer both its rights and obligations under this Agreement and you must sign any novation or other document Secure requires for that purpose.</p>\n<p>14.11 To the extent that any provision or part of this Agreement is either invalid or unenforceable by any applicable law that provisions or part shall be ineffective and shall not invalidate or modify the remaining provisions or parts hereof, which shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>14.12 Time shall be of the essence for the purposes of this Agreement in respect of your obligations. No time or other indulgence granted by Secure shall constitute a waiver of any of its rights herein or at law and Secure shall not be precluded from exercising any such rights against you which may have arisen in the past or which might arise in the future.</p>\n<p>14.13 If Secure makes parking available to you after you are given this Agreement you are taken to have accepted this Agreement and it binds you even if Secure or you do not date or sign it.</p>\n<p>14.14 For internal accounting purposes Secure may clear a credit balance at any time more than 12 months after you last incurred charges. Secure is not required to investigate or refund credit balances to you until requested to do so in writing.</p>\n<p><strong>15.&nbsp;Flexi Perm</strong></p>\n<p>15.15 If the Authorised Parker has selected a Flexi Perm space they must only access the Secure Car Park with their Vehicle on the Nominated Days using the Flexi Perm PIN. If the Vehicle accesses the Secure Car Park on days other than the Nominated Days the usual drive in casual rates will apply. If the Vehicle enters the Secure Car Park on a Nominated Day but remains in the Secure Car Park on the following day and that following day is not a Nominated Day then the Authorised Parker will be liable to pay an &ldquo;Overstay Fee&rdquo; which will be the amount calculated at the casual drive up rate for the relevant Secure Car Park commencing on the first day which is not a Nominated Day and ending on the day the Vehicle leaves the relevant Secure Car Park (Overstay Period). For the avoidance of doubt the Authorised Parker will not be entitled to any refund or credit for Nominated Days which may fall within the Overstay Period. The Flexi Perm Pin is valid for multiple entries and exits on the Nominated Days during normal operating hours.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"

If for any reason:<br />a. any aspect of the More Program is not able to be fulfilled/completed; or<br />b. the participant&rsquo;s membership of Club Secure is terminated or rescinded; or<br />c. the participant unsubscribes from the Club Secure database,&nbsp;the participant will not be entitled to receive the benefits of the More Program (if any).<br />5. Where the More Program provides a reward to a Participant, receipt of the reward is subject to the&nbsp;terms and conditions of the More Program and the More Rewards terms and conditions.<br />6. A participant will receive More Rewards when their More Status reaches a specific More&nbsp;Rewards Spend Milestone.<br />7. Secure Parking is not required to disclose the spend value of a More Reward Milestone or advise a&nbsp;participant the amount they need to spend to reach a More Reward Milestone. A participant will be&nbsp;able to track their progress towards their next More Reward by viewing the More Rewards<br />Status Bar which will be available in emails they receive from Club Secure. The More Rewards&nbsp;Status Bar provides a representation of where a participant&rsquo;s cumulative spend is in relation to the next&nbsp;available More Reward and is not intended to provide an exact position.<br />8. A participant&rsquo;s More Status is based on their lifetime Cumulative Spend on Online Booking Transactions on an individual&nbsp;Book Online&nbsp;account. If a participant has multiple&nbsp;Book Online&nbsp;accounts, each account will have its own More Status based on the cumulative spend within that&nbsp;account. A participant will not be permitted to&nbsp; combine the cumulative spend on multiple accounts to achieve a higher More Status.<br />9. At the time of the launch of the&nbsp; More Program, a participant&rsquo;s More Status will be set at the&nbsp;most recent record of the Cumulative Spend on&nbsp;Online&nbsp;Booking Transactions.<br />10. There may at times be a lag between a participant&rsquo;s actual Cumulative Spend and the Cumulative&nbsp;Spend on which the Participant&rsquo;s More Status is based.<br />11. If by successfully completing a Online Booking Transaction, a participant&rsquo;s cumulative spend passes&nbsp;through more than one More Reward Milestone, the Promoter will only be liable to provide the&nbsp;participant with the More Reward that applies to the higher More Reward Spend Milestone.<br />12. More Rewards may change at the discretion of the Promoter and may not be offered for to all Club&nbsp;Secure Members.<br />13. The Promoter reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to vary or cancel, terminate or suspend the&nbsp; More Program or other benefit or promotion in connection with the More Program at any time&nbsp;without prior notice. Should any dispute arise, the decision of the Promoter shall be final.<br />14. Employees of the Promoter, its related entities or consultants as well as their Immediate Families and&nbsp;friends, are ineligible to participant in the More Program.<br />15. To the extent permitted by law the Promoter and its employees and agents will not be liable for:<br />a. personal injury, death, damage to or loss of property, financial loss, lost profit, or loss of&nbsp;opportunity or other economic loss arising from the act or omission of any person in the&nbsp;delivery, supply or use of the More Reward and whether the act or omission is deliberate,&nbsp;reckless, negligent or otherwise constitutes a tort, breaches any statutory duty or any contract;<br />b. any failure by any third party (including any sponsor or the supplier of any More Reward to&nbsp;provide a More Reward or to provide it as promised as a result of&nbsp; bankruptcy or entry into any other form of administration in insolvency;<br />c. any defect in any More Reward;<br />d. the consequences of late or misdirected mail, including but not limited to the consequence that&nbsp;you may not actually receive notice that you have received a More Reward;<br />e. the consequences of any fraud or cheating of any entrant or third person;<br />f. loss of any kind caused by any event outside our reasonable control of, including but not&nbsp;limited to strikes and other industrial action, wars, acts of terrorism, natural disaster, inclement&nbsp;weather and acts of God; or<br />g. any tax liability incurred as a result of receiving a More Reward or other benefit as a result&nbsp;of participating in the More Program. You must obtain independent tax and financial&nbsp;advice.<br />16. By participating in the More Program and providing their Personal Information you consent to&nbsp;receiving electronic newsletters from the Promoter and materials about the Promoter&rsquo;s services.<br />17. The Promoter offers More Rewards and benefits in connection with the More Program as&nbsp;trustee for the Secure Kings Unit Trust and in no other capacity. Any liability of the Promoter arising&nbsp;under or in connection with this program is limited to the amount the Promoter is entitled to and actually&nbsp;receives in the exercise of its right of indemnity from the property of the Trust.<br />18. The Promoter may not be sued in any capacity other than as trustee for the Trust, including seeking the&nbsp;appointment of a receiver (except in relation to the property of the Trust), a liquidator, an administrator&nbsp;or any similar person to the Promoter or provide in any liquidation, administration or arrangement of or<br />affecting the Promoter (except in relation to the property of the Trust).<br />19. If a participant in the More Program tampers with, or subverts, the processes relating to&nbsp;participation in the More Program, or may benefit from such tampering or subversion by any other&nbsp;person, the Promoter reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify that participant.<br />20. Nothing in these conditions varies any terms or conditions applicable to the supply of goods or services&nbsp;by us.<br />21. All transactional data of participants in the More Program become the property of the Promoter.&nbsp;The Promoter&rsquo;s decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into.<br />22.

The Australian Consumer Law (<strong>ACL</strong>) provides consumers with guarantees that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. These Terms do not affect any rights you have under the ACL or any other legal rights which cannot be excluded or modified.</p>\n<p>4. For services that are not services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal domestic or household use or consumption, and/or where you are in trade, you agree that we limit our liability, as permitted by the ACL, at our option, to the re-supply of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>\n<p>5. Subject to clause 3 above and any other legal restriction:</p>\n<p>(a) we are not liable for any indirect, special, consequential or economic loss or damage whether or not arising from default or negligence by us or our employees or agents; and</p>\n<p>(b) To the extent permitted by the ACL, we exclude all terms, conditions, warranties, guarantees (either express or implied), and any liability that might apply to us in respect of these Terms or anything done under them.</p>\n<p>6. If you leave the keys to the Vehicle with us, you authorise us to deliver the Vehicle to any person producing a ticket we have issued to you for the Vehicle or to any person producing other evidence of entitlement to the Vehicle satisfactory to us.</p>\n<p>7. No employee, agent or contractor of Secure Parking has authority to accept any goods for safe custody and we will not be liable for any loss or damage to any vehicle or property alleged to have been left by you with us or any employee, agent or contractor, regardless of how that loss or damage is caused.</p>\n<p>8. You release us from all actions and demands due to any loss, death, damage or injury occurring in the Car Park, including but not limited to, as a result of risk. We are not liable for any loss or damage to, without limitation, any vehicle, accessories, contents or personal property left with us, in the Vehicle or in the Car Park.</p>\n<p>9. You must pay us upon demand all parking fees and other costs incurred in relation to the Vehicle being in the Car Park, based on the schedule of fees displayed at the time of entry into the Car Park or any other fee arrangement we may have agreed with you. A further parking fee may be payable each time the Vehicle enters the Car Park. If you are issued with a physical ticket on entry to the Car Park and you lose or fail to present a ticket required to be presented upon leaving the Car Park, you will be charged the maximum amount payable for use of the Car Park.</p>\n<p>10. You grant us a &lsquo;security interest&rsquo; (as defined in the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 Cth (<strong>PPSA</strong>)) in the Vehicle to secure everything you owe us in respect of these Terms. We may retain possession of the Vehicle until everything you owe us in respect of this contract has been paid. Parking fees will continue to accrue during the period that we retain the Vehicle until we recover all fees and costs. If amounts due to us in respect of these Terms remain unpaid after 30 days, you agree that we can sell the Vehicle and use the proceeds to pay the amounts you owe us and you agree to take all steps required by us to enable us to do so. Our rights and powers in relation to the security interest described in this clause do not limit our rights and powers under the PPSA. Nothing in this contract limits or excludes any common law or statutory lien or other rights we have over the Vehicle.</p>\n<p>11. We reserve the right for us and our contractors or agents to enter the Vehicle and to move it if we decide that it is reasonably necessary to do so in an emergency or for the safe or efficient operation of this Car Park. We may charge you a reasonable amount for moving the Vehicle if the need to move it arises:</p>\n<p>(a) because you breach these Terms or have caused obstruction;</p>\n<p>(b) we reasonably believe the Vehicle is abandoned; or</p>\n<p>(c) during the period of retention or sale for non-payment.</p>\n<p>12. You must pay for any damage caused by you or the Vehicle to this Car Park including, but not limited to, any damage caused by oil or other substances which leak from the Vehicle.</p>\n<p>13. You must indemnify us in respect of all losses, costs (including reasonable legal costs) or expenses that we may suffer or incur in respect of: (a) a breach of these Terms by you; (b) the Vehicle; or (c) your use of this Car Park. In the case of paragraphs (b) and (c) your liability to indemnify is reduced to the extent that any relevant expense is caused by our negligence or default.</p>\n<p>This clause does not affect any rights and remedies that may be available to you under the ACL or other law which cannot be excluded or modified. The use of the word &lsquo;Secure&rsquo; in our name and logo does not express or imply any warranty about the security of the Car Park.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"
